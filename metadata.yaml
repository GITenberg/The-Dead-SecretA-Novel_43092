description: Rosamond Treverton lay dying at Porthgenna Tower, the family mansion
  in Cornwall. Calling her lady's maid to her side she confesses a terrible secret
  from her past, but dies before she can extract a promise from Sarah to reveal all
  to her husband. Hiding the written confession in a remote part of the mansion, Sarah
  carries the burden alone for fifteen years. Worn out by the strain, it is at this
  point that she is pitched headlong into a chain of events which could lead to discovery
  by the innocent she is trying to protect. Will the secret be revealed? What lies
  in store for the young Rosamond, her blind husband and their infant son, heir to
  Porthgenna?
